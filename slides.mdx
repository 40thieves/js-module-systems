## Module Systems in JavaScript

## Module system?

A system where you can import into the current "module" exported code from another "module"

- Often, this "module" is refers to a file, but not necessarily always
- The scope from context A does not affect the scope from context B
- The context could be third-party code, but also is first party code
- So normal in other languages that you might not have considered it a "feature"

---

## In the beginning

- JavaScript was intended as a scripting language to add interactivity to web pages
- It was not intended to have complex dependencies that our applications have
- Because of this it didn't have any module system for a long time
  - Something that is taken for granted in other languages

---

## People started inventing their own

The simplest thing to do is to wrap everything in an "immediately invoked function expression" (IIFE)

```js
(function() {
  // ... some code here
})()
```

Works ok, but...

- Difficult to reference code from another module/file
- No interoperability

---

There were several competing implementations of a generic module system for JS

We'll look at a couple of the most widely adopted ones

---

## Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)

[Spec](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)

---

```js
define(
  ['path/to/moduleA', 'path/to/moduleB'],
  function(importedValueFromModuleA, importValueFromModuleB) {
    // do something with importedValueFromModuleA/importedValueFromModuleB
    return exportedValue
  }
)
```

You might recognise this from the frontend!

---

- Modules can be asynchronously loaded
  - This is only useful for browsers, so it is not supported by CJS/Node

- Not widely used any more, mostly because of the lack of Node support

---

## CommonJS (CJS)

[Spec](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1)

---

```js
const importedValueFromModuleA = require('path/to/moduleA')
const importedValueFromModuleB = require('path/to/moduleB')

// do something with exportedValueFromModuleA/exportedValueFromModuleB

module.exports = exportedValue
```

You might recognise this from Node!

The CommonJS format was authored by early Node committers and so it was built into Node itself ([Docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html)).

---

`require()` calls are valid anywhere within the module

<Divider />

Exporting relies on simple assignment
- You can do some slightly weird things like exporting a randomised value
- This means that imports/exports can only be determined at runtime

---

## ES Modules (ESM)

[Spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules)

---

```js
import importedValueFromModuleA from 'path/to/moduleA'
import importedValueFromModuleB from 'path/to/moduleB'

// do something with exportedValueFromModuleA/exportedValueFromModuleB

export default exportedValue
```

---

### Named exports

ESM also introduced the concept of "named exports"

```js
export foo
export bar
```

Which are then imported like this:

```js
import { foo, bar } from './foo'
```

---

- ESM is fundamentally different to AMD/CJS: imports/exports are statically determined

- This is useful since it improves guarantees around "tree-shaking"/dead code removal

---

## Using ESM today

---

Thanks to the magic of webpack, we can start using ESM in the frontend today

- Well sort of... webpack is actually compiling ESM syntax away to something like CJS

- We still can take advantages of the static nature of imports to improve tree-shaking

---

In Node the answer is much more complicated

- For complex technical reasons, Node's algorithm can't just switch on support for ESM by default

- There are subtle differences in how JS parses ESM vs CJS. So Node either:
  - Has to parse each file twice
  - Read some metadata declaring a file as using ESM or CJS

- Most of this is now resolved in latest versions of Node, but there are some [gotchas](https://2ality.com/2019/04/nodejs-esm-impl.html)

- 99% of packages are written in CJS, so we are stuck with it for a while
