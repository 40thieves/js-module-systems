## Module Systems in JavaScript

## Module system?

A system where you can import into the current "module" exported code from another "module"

- Often, a "module" is refers to a file, but not necessarily always

- The scope from module A does not affect the scope from module B

- The module could be third-party code, but the majority of usage is first party code

- The concept is so normal in other languages that you might not have considered it a "feature"

---

## In the beginning

---

- JavaScript was intended as a scripting language to add interactivity to web pages

- It was not intended to have complex dependencies that our applications have

- Because of this it didn't have any module system for a long time
  - Something that is taken for granted in other languages

---

## People started inventing their own

---

The simplest thing to do is to wrap everything in an "immediately invoked function expression" (IIFE)

```js
(function() {
  // ... some code here
})()
```

Works ok, but...

- Difficult to reference code from another module/file

- No interoperability across custom systems

---

### Generic module systems

So, people started to consolidate on some generic module systems.

- There were several competing implementations

- We'll look at a couple of the most widely adopted ones

---

## Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)

[Spec](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)

---

```js
define(['path/to/moduleA', 'path/to/moduleB'], function(valueFromModuleA, valueFromModuleB) {
  // do something with valueFromModuleA/valueFromModuleB
  return exportedValue
})
```

---

- You might recognise this from the frontend!

- We used a tool called RequireJS to build the frontend that popularised the AMD format
  - We have now migrated to webpack, which can parse the AMD format code

- Modules can be asynchronously loaded
  - This is only useful for browsers, so it is not supported by CJS/Node

- Not widely used any more, mostly because of the lack of Node support

---

## CommonJS (CJS)

[Spec](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1)

---

```js
const valueFromModuleA = require('path/to/moduleA')
const valueFromModuleB = require('path/to/moduleB')

// do something with valueFromModuleA/valueFromModuleB

module.exports = exportedValue
```

---

- You might recognise this from the backend!

- The CommonJS format was authored by early Node committers and so it was built into Node itself ([Docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html)).

- `require()` calls are valid anywhere within the module
  - This means you can set up circular dependencies

- Exporting relies on assignment
  - You can do some slightly weird things like exporting a randomised value
  - This means that imports/exports can only be determined at runtime

---

## ES Modules (ESM)

[Spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-modules)

---

```js
import valueFromModuleA from 'path/to/moduleA'
import valueFromModuleB from 'path/to/moduleB'

// do something with valueFromModuleA/valueFromModuleB

export default exportedValue
```

---

### Named exports

ESM also introduced the concept of "named exports"

```js
export const foo = 'hello'
export function bar() { ... }
```

Which are then imported like this:

```js
import { foo, bar } from './foo'
```

There are actually a more ways of [importing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Syntax) and [exporting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export#Syntax).

---

## ESM is fundamentally different to AMD/CJS

---

- Imports/exports are statically determined
  - This is useful since it improves guarantees around "tree-shaking"/dead code removal

- The designers had the benefit of being able to change the language itself
  - Although, unfortuntely they didn't really consider usage within Node

---

## Using ESM today

Now it is built into the language, I think it is the future for all JS code

---

### In the frontend

Thanks to webpack, we can start using ESM in the frontend today

- Well sort of... webpack is actually compiling ESM syntax away to something like CJS

- We still can take advantages of the static nature of imports to improve tree-shaking

---

### In the backend

The answer is much more complicated in Node

- For complex technical reasons, support for ESM can't be easily switched on in Node's algorithm

- There are subtle differences in how JS parses ESM vs CJS. So Node either:
  - Has to parse each file twice (which has performance implications), or
  - Read some metadata declaring a file as using ESM or CJS

- Most of this is now resolved in latest versions of Node, but there are some [gotchas](https://2ality.com/2019/04/nodejs-esm-impl.html)

- 99% of packages are written in CJS, so we are stuck with it for a while
